# Machine-Learning FIFA Ranking Analysis
# Introduction
You have been recruited as a football analyst in a company - Mchezopesa Ltd and tasked to accomplish the task below.
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training).
You have two possible approaches (as  shown below) given the datasets that will be provided
Input: Home team, Away team, Tournament type (World cup, Friendly, Other)
## Problem Statement
A prediction result of a game between team 1 and team 2, based on who's home and who's away, and on whether or not the game is friendly (include rank in your training). In order to work on the above problem, you need to do the following:
* Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
* Perform your EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering 
* Check of multicollinearity
* Start building the model
* Cross-validate the model
* Compute RMSE
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test
* Perform appropriate regressions on the data including your justification
* Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements.
## Data Source
There are two datasets; ranking and results dataset (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYUqaEEnFtAe5lvzJh9lpVpR2MAvERUc/view). They have appropriate columns to answer the questions. They are both relevant for our analysis.
Both our datasets consists of information on football rankings over time and are therefore suitable to create a model that will be used to predict the results
